## Under Construction ðŸš§

## Embeddings

### 1. GloVe - Wikipedia

## Board words

- Improve embeddings (embeddings can guess really wrong and fact of generic and difficult clue)
- Include logic for assassin and neutral cards

## Commands

### (Optional) Creating a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv codenames_env
```

```

### Setting Up and Running the Project

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash

```

## Mac (Python 3.12 required)
